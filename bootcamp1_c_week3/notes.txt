To write better structured code, we're going to have
- The main program
- A header file that contains the forward declarations of the functions (utils.h)
- Another c file that contains the contents of each function (utils.c)

To compile all the files that are using the header we will do the following

gcc -c utils.c // will produce utils.o
gcc -c create_file_h.c // will produce create_file_h.o
gcc create_file_h.o utils.o -o create_file // puts both files into 1 executible
